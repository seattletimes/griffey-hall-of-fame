            From early in his career, it was apparent that Ken Griffey Jr. was going to be something special. Griffey amassed 87 home runs in his first four years -- all before his 23rd birthday, averaging nearly 22 home runs per season. While impressive, the totals were nowhere near as impressive as what was to come.</div>
          <div class="comp-chatter" data-id="b">        <div class="circle">B</div>
            Then the power spike came. It started when Griffey hit 45 home runs in 1993, and continued for the next seven years. Over that span, Griffey averaged 44 home runs per season, a feat made more impressive by the fact that he played in only 72 games in 1995 because of injury. In 1997 he set a career-high with 56 homers, a feat he would match the following year. By the time that eight-year run was over, As the graph shows, Griffey's pace put him ahead of that set by the all-time home run leaders.</div>
          <div class="comp-chatter" data-id="c">        <div class="circle">C</div>
            But then injuries struck. Over the next four years, Griffey played in fewer than half of his team's games as he battled injuries to his knees, ankle, hamstrings and shoulder. On top of missing valuable playing time, the injury struggles also sapped him of much of his power. By the time he finally began to regain health in 2005, he had fallen well off the pace.</div>
          <div class="comp-chatter" data-id="d">        <div class="circle">D</div>
            Finally healthy, his power began to pick back up, but he never regained the heights he had previously reached. Even if he had, there might simply have not been enough time for him to put the home run record in danger. Instead, when he finally retired in June of 2010, he left the baseball world as one of the undisputed all-time greats. But it's hard not to look back at injuries and wonder "what if?"</div>

            Griffey’s first S.I. cover is also his most iconic. The magazine calls him “Seattle’s 20-year-old wonder” and likens him to Willie Mays.
