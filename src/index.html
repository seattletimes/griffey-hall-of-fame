            Numbers don’t begin to tell the story of Ken Griffey Jr.’s Hall of Fame career. They don’t tell you how graceful The Kid chased down balls in the Mariners' outfield, they don’t paint a picture of his infectious, trademark grin, and they certainly can’t define what this legend meant for the city of Seattle. But, the numbers do make one thing clear: No. 24 was No. 1 in baseball for a long time.

              From early in his career, it was apparent that Ken Griffey Jr. was going to be something special. Griffey amassed 87 home runs in his first four years &mdash; all before his 23rd birthday, averaging nearly 22 home runs per season. While impressive, the totals were nowhere near as impressive as what was to come.</div>
          <div class="comp-chatter show" data-id="b">        <div class="circle">B</div>
            <div class="career-years">Next 8 years (1993-2000)</div><br>
            Then the power spike came. It began when Griffey hit 45 home runs in 1993, and continued for the next seven years. Over that span, Griffey averaged 44 home runs per season, a feat made more impressive by the fact he played just 72 games in 1995 due to injury. In 1997 he set a career-high with 56 homers, a number he would match the following year. By the time that eight-year run was over, as the graph above shows, Griffey's pace put him ahead of the all-time home run leaders.</div>

            <div class="career-years">Next 4 years (2001-2004)</div><br>
            But then injuries struck. Over the next four years, Griffey played in fewer than half of his team's games as he battled injuries to his knees, ankle, hamstrings and shoulder. On top of missing valuable playing time, the injury struggles also sapped him of much of his power. By the time he finally began to regain health in 2005, he had fallen well off the pace.</div>
          <div class="comp-chatter show" data-id="d">        <div class="circle">D</div>
            <div class="career-years">Final 6 years (2005-2010)</div><br>
            Finally healthy, his power began to pick back up, but he never returned to the heights he had previously reached. Even if he had, there might not have been time for him to put the home run record in danger. When Griffey finally retired in June 2010, he left the baseball world as one of the undisputed all-time greats. But it's hard not to look back at his injuries and wonder, “What if?"</div>

            Griffey’s first S.I. cover is also his most iconic. The magazine calls him “Seattle’s 20-year-old wonder” and likens him to Willie Mays.
